          <h3>2. Ownership.</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that Tanooki Suit, LLC. (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all legal right, title
            and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have in and

          <h3>3. License.</h3>
          <p>Subject to your continued compliance with the terms of this License, Tanooki Suit, LLC. grants you a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased NFTs,
            solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace
            that permits the purchase and sale of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each

            the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
            participation of your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s
            rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art,
            and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application.</p>
          <h3>4. Restrictions.</h3>
          <p>You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without Tanooki
            Suit, LLC.'s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased NFT in any way,
            including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the Art
            for your Purchased NFTs to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for
            your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance,
            violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe
            upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of
            media, except to the limited extent that such use is solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell,
            distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial
            gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased
            NFTs; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or
            to the Art for your Purchased NFTs; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased NFTs for your or any
            third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contain Third Party
            IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and
            agree as follows: (x) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated
            in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (y) that, depending on the nature of
            the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Tanooki Suit, LLC. may need to pass through additional
            restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (z) to the extent that Tanooki Suit, LLC. informs you of such
            additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such
            restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of
            this license.</p>
          <h3>5. Terms of License.</h3>
          <p>The license granted in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that you continue to own the applicable Purchased
            NFT. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT
            for any reason, the license granted in Section 3 will immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the
            requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those NFTs.</p>
